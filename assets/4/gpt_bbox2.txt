Aspect ratio check (using absolute sizes and normalizing by X):

- a camera
  - Sizes: X = 0.7142, Y = 0.50, Z = 0.3571
  - Normalized (Y/X, Z/X): 0.700, 0.500 → matches 1 : 0.7 : 0.5

- a lens
  - Sizes: X = 0.40, Y = 0.40, Z = 0.32
  - Normalized (Y/X, Z/X): 1.000, 0.800 → matches 1 : 1.0 : 0.8

- a tripod
  - Sizes: X = 0.5625, Y = 0.90, Z = 0.5625
  - Normalized (Y/X, Z/X): 1.600, 1.000 → matches 1 : 1.6 : 1.0

Heights are natural and realistic: tripod (0.90) > camera (0.50) > lens (0.40). All corners are within the scene bounds, and objects are close on X without overlapping.

No updates needed. Final bounding boxes:

{
  "a camera": [-0.3571, -0.60, 2.10, 0.3571, -0.10, 2.4571],
  "a lens": [0.40, -0.60, 2.15, 0.80, -0.20, 2.47],
  "a tripod": [-1.08125, -1.00, 3.80, -0.51875, -0.10, 4.3625]
