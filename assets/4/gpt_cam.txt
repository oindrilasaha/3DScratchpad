Fourth proposal view.

Reasoning:
- Camera is clearly front-facing.
- Lens sits beside the camera with its opening oriented left, matching “faces left.”
- Tripod is placed behind the camera and leans to the right, with good separation and visibility.
- Other views either obscure the tripod (3), show the camera’s back (5), introduce angle/ambiguity or unclear lens orientation (1, 2).
