Analysis of aspect ratios (normalized by X size)

- a left shoe
  - Box: [-0.15, -1.00, 2.86, 0.55, -0.65, 3.14]
  - Sizes ΔX=0.70, ΔY=0.35, ΔZ=0.28 → normalized (1 : 0.5 : 0.4)
  - Matches required 1 : 0.5 : 0.4

- a right shoe
  - Box: [-0.95, -1.00, 2.90, -0.25, -0.65, 3.18]
  - Sizes ΔX=0.70, ΔY=0.35, ΔZ=0.28 → normalized (1 : 0.5 : 0.4)
  - Matches required 1 : 0.5 : 0.4

- an empty shoebox
  - Box: [0.60, -1.00, 3.90, 1.50, -0.19, 4.44]
  - Sizes ΔX=0.90, ΔY=0.81, ΔZ=0.54 → normalized (1 : 0.9 : 0.6)
  - Matches required 1 : 0.9 : 0.6

Height realism (compare only Y sizes)
- Shoes: 0.35 each; Shoebox: 0.81. The box is taller than the shoes, which is reasonable with the lid open and remains within scene limits. All Y sizes ≥ 0.3.

No aspect-ratio corrections are needed. Final bounding boxes (unchanged):

{
  "a left shoe": [-0.15, -1.00, 2.86, 0.55, -0.65, 3.14],
  "a right shoe": [-0.95, -1.00, 2.90, -0.25, -0.65, 3.18],
  "an empty shoebox": [0.60, -1.00, 3.90, 1.50, -0.19, 4.44]
