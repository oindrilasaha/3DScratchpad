Aspect-ratio check (sizes from your earlier boxes and normalized by X size)
- a sofa: X=1.20, Y=0.60, Z=0.48 → normalized (Y/X, Z/X) = (0.5, 0.4). Matches target 1:0.5:0.4.
- an empty bookshelf: X=0.90, Y=1.71, Z=0.36 → normalized = (1.9, 0.4). Matches 1:1.9:0.4.
- a left speaker: X=0.35, Y=0.49, Z=0.32 → normalized = (1.4, 0.914). Z/X was too large; should be 0.9.
- a right speaker: X=0.30, Y=0.42, Z=0.21 → normalized = (1.4, 0.7). Matches 1:1.4:0.7.

Height realism (compare Y sizes only): bookshelf 1.71 (tallest), sofa 0.60 (mid), speakers 0.49 and 0.42 (shorter). All ≥ 0.3 and realistic.

Correction applied
- Adjusted the left speaker’s Z size to exactly 0.9×X (Z = 0.315 for X = 0.35). Placement remains valid within the trapezoid and does not introduce X overlap with the sofa.

Updated 3D bounding boxes dict
{
  'a sofa': [-0.60, -1.00, 2.50, 0.60, -0.40, 2.98],
  'an empty bookshelf': [-0.45, -1.00, 3.15, 0.45, 0.71, 3.51],
  'a left speaker': [0.78, -1.00, 2.45, 1.13, -0.51, 2.765],
  'a right speaker': [-1.10, -1.00, 2.46, -0.80, -0.58, 2.67]
}

All corners remain within the scene bounds at their respective Z depths, objects stay close in X without overlapping, and relative heights remain natural.
