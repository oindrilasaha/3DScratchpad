Planned scene
- Room: flat floor at Y = -1.0 and a neutral back wall around Z ≈ 4.6 so the bookshelf reads as “behind” the sofa. No other furniture.
- Composition: Sofa centered and nearer the viewer. Tall bookshelf centered behind the sofa (slightly rotated left later). Two compact speakers on the floor at the sofa’s sides, angled inward later. All sizes respect the given X:Y:Z aspect ratios, with realistic relative heights.

3D bounding boxes [x0, y0, z0, x1, y1, z1]
- a sofa: [-0.60, -1.00, 2.50, 0.60, -0.40, 2.98]
  - Size (X,Y,Z) ≈ (1.20, 0.60, 0.48) → ratio 1 : 0.5 : 0.4
- an empty bookshelf: [-0.45, -1.00, 3.15, 0.45, 0.71, 3.51]
  - Size (X,Y,Z) ≈ (0.90, 1.71, 0.36) → ratio 1 : 1.9 : 0.4
- a left speaker: [0.78, -1.00, 2.45, 1.13, -0.51, 2.77]
  - Size (X,Y,Z) ≈ (0.35, 0.49, 0.32) → ratio 1 : 1.4 : 0.9
- a right speaker: [-1.10, -1.00, 2.46, -0.80, -0.58, 2.67]
  - Size (X,Y,Z) ≈ (0.30, 0.42, 0.21) → ratio 1 : 1.4 : 0.7

Notes on placement
- All corners lie within the trapezoidal frustum (X bounds at each Z respected). 
- The speakers’ X extents do not overlap the sofa’s X extent; the bookshelf overlaps in X but sits behind and is much taller, so it remains visible as requested.
- Heights are natural: bookshelf tallest (~1.71), sofa mid-height (~0.60), speakers shorter (~0.42–0.49).

Orientation suggestions (to apply after placing the boxes; boxes assume the original image orientations)
- Sofa: upright on the floor, front facing toward the camera (≈ facing -Z).
- Bookshelf: upright; yaw a few degrees to the left (≈ +10° to +15° about Y) so its front turns slightly toward +X.
- Left speaker (on the viewer’s left/+X side): upright; yaw about -20° so it turns inward toward the sofa.
- Right speaker (on the viewer’s right/-X side): upright; yaw about +20° so it turns inward toward the sofa.

If you want the bookshelf tighter to the sofa, it can move forward to start around Z ≈ 3.0 while keeping z1 well below 5.0.
