The current scene already matches the prompt: the kettle (spout to the right) sits beside the oven (door open toward the viewer), and the toaster faces forward. To emphasize “behind,” I’ll just push the toaster a bit farther back so it’s fully behind the oven while keeping everything visible and physically plausible. No rotations are needed.
