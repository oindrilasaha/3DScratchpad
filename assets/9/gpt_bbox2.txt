Analysis of aspect ratios

- Suitcase
  - Box: [-0.100, -1.000, 2.350, 0.300, -0.280, 2.550]
  - Sizes: X = 0.300 − (−0.100) = 0.40; Y = −0.280 − (−1.000) = 0.72; Z = 2.550 − 2.350 = 0.20
  - Normalized (divide by X): [1, 0.72/0.40, 0.20/0.40] = [1, 1.8, 0.5]
  - Target = [1, 1.8, 0.5] → exact match.

- Backpack
  - Box: [-0.590, -1.000, 2.800, -0.160, -0.400, 3.270]
  - Sizes: X = 0.43; Y = 0.60; Z = 0.47
  - Normalized: [1, 0.60/0.43, 0.47/0.43] ≈ [1, 1.395, 1.093]
  - Target = [1, 1.4, 1.1] → matches within rounding (<1% deviation).

Relative heights check (Y sizes only)
- Suitcase height = 0.72; Backpack height = 0.60. This is natural and realistic (carry-on with extended handle slightly taller than a backpack).

Conclusion: Aspect ratios are maintained; relative heights are plausible. No changes needed.
