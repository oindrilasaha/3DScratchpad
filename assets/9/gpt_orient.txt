The scene already looks physically plausible and matches most of the prompt: the suitcase is upright with handle extended and faces forward; the backpack sits behind it and is fully visible. The only tweak needed is to yaw the backpack a bit to the viewer’s left so it’s “turned partially left.”

Here are minimal adjustments:

{
  "a suitcase with its handle extended upward": {
    "scale": 1.0,
    "rotation": [0, 0, 0],
    "translation": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  },
  "a backpack": {
    "scale": 1.0,
    "rotation": [-5, 30, 0],
    "translation": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  }
}

Notes:
- Backpack yaw +30° (about Y) turns its front slightly toward the scene’s left (+X), as requested. A small forward lean (pitch -5° about X) is added for naturalism.
- No translation is needed since the backpack is already clearly behind (larger Z) and separated laterally from the suitcase in the front view.
