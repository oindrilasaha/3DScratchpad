Analysis of normalized aspect ratios

- A silver hatchback
  - Spans: ΔX = 0.50, ΔY = 0.50, ΔZ = 0.80
  - Normalized (divide by ΔX): 1 : 1.0 : 1.6
  - Target: 1 : 1.0 : 1.6 → Match

- A tractor
  - Spans: ΔX = 0.60, ΔY = 0.72, ΔZ = 0.90
  - Normalized: 1 : 1.2 : 1.5
  - Target: 1 : 1.2 : 1.5 → Match

Height realism (compare only Y spans)
- Hatchback height = 0.50
- Tractor height = 0.72
- The tractor is taller than the hatchback, which is realistic; both ≥ 0.3. No adjustment needed.

Since all normalized aspect ratios and relative heights are correct, the boxes remain unchanged.
