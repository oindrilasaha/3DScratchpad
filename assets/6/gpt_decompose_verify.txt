You’re right to double-check. I had added new background entities (tabletop, wall), used “tonearm” instead of “arm,” and referenced the viewer. I’ve simplified and corrected these, and marked items that usually contain other elements as empty.

Subjects:
- a vintage radio angled to the right, dial side visible
- an empty record player with its arm positioned inward toward the center
- an empty record sleeve facing forward

Background:
- a simple neutral background with warm, soft lighting and gentle shadows creating a cozy retro still-life mood
