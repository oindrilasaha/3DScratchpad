First proposal view.

Reason:
- It best matches the prompt layout: record player on the left, radio on the right, sleeve behind them facing forward.
- The radio’s dial side is visible and the unit is angled to the right.
- The record player’s arm appears inward and is clearly visible.
- The sleeve is centered behind and mostly unobstructed, giving good depth and a balanced composition.

Other views either obscure the sleeve, hide the radio’s dial side, or use overhead angles that reduce prompt fidelity.
