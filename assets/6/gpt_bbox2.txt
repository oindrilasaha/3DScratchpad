Analysis of normalized aspect ratios from the previously proposed boxes

For each object:
- Compute size in each axis: dx = x1 − x0, dy = y1 − y0, dz = z1 − z0.
- Normalize by X: (1, dy/dx, dz/dx).

1) a vintage radio, dial side visible
- dx = 0.306 − (−0.050) = 0.356
- dy = −0.680 − (−1.000) = 0.320
- dz = 2.728 − 2.550 = 0.178
- Normalized = 1 : 0.320/0.356 ≈ 0.899 : 0.178/0.356 = 0.500
- Target = 1 : 0.9 : 0.5 → Match within 0.1%.

2) an empty record player
- dx = 0.710 − 0.360 = 0.350
- dy = −0.650 − (−1.000) = 0.350
- dz = 2.900 − 2.620 = 0.280
- Normalized = 1 : 1.000 : 0.800
- Target = 1 : 1.0 : 0.8 → Exact match.

3) an empty record sleeve
- dx = 0.600 − 0.000 = 0.600
- dy = −0.400 − (−1.000) = 0.600
- dz = 3.900 − 3.300 = 0.600
- Normalized = 1 : 1.000 : 1.000
- Target = 1 : 1.0 : 1.0 → Exact match.

Height (Y) realism check
- Radio height = 0.320
- Record player height = 0.350
- Sleeve height = 0.600
These are all ≥ 0.3 as required. The sleeve is taller to remain visible behind the devices, while the radio and player are close in height, which reads naturally.

Conclusion
- All three objects maintain the required normalized aspect ratios.
- Relative heights are natural and realistic for the intended scene.
- No updates to the boxes are necessary.
