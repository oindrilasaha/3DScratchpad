Analysis of normalized aspect ratios (sizes are ΔX, ΔY, ΔZ; normalized = [1, ΔY/ΔX, ΔZ/ΔX])

- a bus, angled left
  - Sizes: ΔX=0.818, ΔY=0.900, ΔZ=2.045
  - Normalized: [1, 1.100, 2.501]
  - Target: [1, 1.1, 2.5]
  - Match: Yes (within rounding)

- a cyclist riding straight forward, fully visible
  - Sizes: ΔX=0.600, ΔY=0.600, ΔZ=0.180
  - Normalized: [1, 1.000, 0.300]
  - Target: [1, 1.0, 0.3]
  - Match: Yes

- a traffic cone leaning left
  - Sizes: ΔX=0.292, ΔY=0.350, ΔZ=0.292
  - Normalized: [1, 1.199, 1.000]
  - Target: [1, 1.2, 1.0]
  - Match: Yes

Relative heights (ΔY only) and realism
- Bus ΔY=0.900 > Cyclist ΔY=0.600 > Cone ΔY=0.350. All ≥ 0.3 and realistic.

Conclusion: Aspect ratios are correctly maintained and heights are natural. No updates needed.
