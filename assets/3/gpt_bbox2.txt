Analysis of aspect ratios and sizes

For each object, I compute absolute sizes ΔX, ΔY, ΔZ = (x1−x0, y1−y0, z1−z0) and normalize by ΔX.

- a monitor with an empty screen
  - ΔX=0.80, ΔY=0.72, ΔZ=0.32
  - Normalized (Y/X, Z/X) = (0.72/0.80=0.90, 0.32/0.80=0.40)
  - Target = (0.90, 0.40) → matches exactly.

- a laptop with an empty screen
  - ΔX=0.50, ΔY=0.35, ΔZ=0.25
  - Normalized = (0.35/0.50=0.70, 0.25/0.50=0.50)
  - Target = (0.70, 0.50) → matches exactly.

- a table lamp
  - ΔX=0.40, ΔY=0.60, ΔZ=0.40
  - Normalized = (0.60/0.40=1.50, 0.40/0.40=1.00)
  - Target = (1.50, 1.00) → matches exactly.

Heights (ΔY) and realism
- Monitor: 0.72
- Lamp: 0.60
- Laptop: 0.35
These are natural for a desk scene and all are ≥ 0.30.

Scene bounds/trapezoid check
- All corners lie within X ∈ [−0.5Z, +0.5Z] for their respective Z and within Y ∈ [−1, +1]. Depths are well under 5.0, and spacing in X is close without overlap.

No changes are required. The original boxes already satisfy the normalized aspect ratios, realistic relative heights, and scene constraints.
